# Motivation
The purpose of this project is to create a hidden markov model to complete the classification task of identifying spam/not spam messages from the SMS dataset collection. The Viterbi algorithm is used for applying the HMM, and gradient descent is used to train the model based on loss.

# Running the code
This code "trimboli_ICP_code" was developed in Google Colab using their standard packages. If you would like to run the model for yourself, I would advise running it through Colab directly.

Either upload the .ipymb to Colab directly or recreate the packages from their servers.

The dataset is formatted so that downloading it will work in Colab's workspace. Running this notebook outside of Colab will require the paths to be adjusted accordingly.

For convenience, I have provided a link to the SMS spam dataset in this repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection
